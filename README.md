# Vehicle Activity Identification: Data Collection App

This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project is generously supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Resilient Infrastructure & Disaster Response Center (RIDER) at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. Our project focuses on the innovative use of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to identify and analyze vehicle movement. This research aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of transportation systems by providing more accurate data on vehicle dynamics.

## Objectives üéØ

The primary objective of this REU project is to develop and refine algorithms that can effectively interpret data from IMU sensors to detect and categorize different types of vehicle movements. By achieving this, the project seeks to contribute to the development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicle technologies. Participants in this project will engage in a variety of research activities, including:

Designing and implementing experiments to gather accurate IMU data from vehicles under different conditions.
Developing machine learning models to interpret IMU data and recognize patterns in vehicle behavior.
Collaborating with industry experts and academics to integrate findings into broader transportation system analyses.

## Impact üåç

The outcomes of this research are expected to have significant impacts on multiple fronts:

* Technological: Advancement in sensor technologies and data analysis techniques.
* Educational: Providing valuable hands-on research experience to undergraduate students, enhancing their skills and preparing them for future careers in engineering and technology.
